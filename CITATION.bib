  abstract = {Metabolite-disease associations play critical roles in understanding disease mechanisms and discovering biomarkers. Traditional computational methods rely on pairwise graph representations, limiting their capacity to capture higher-order multi-entity interactions. We propose DHG-LGB, a novel framework integrating disease hypergraph representation with LightGBM classification for metabolite-disease association prediction. By representing diseases as hyperedges connecting metabolites, proteins, and Gene Ontology terms, our hypergraph captures complex multi-way biological relationships. Hypergraph Neural Networks learn context-dependent embeddings through message passing, while LightGBM provides efficient gradient boosting classification. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DHG-LGB achieves exceptional performance (AUC = 0.9983, MCC = 0.9305, AUPRC = 0.9860) under 5-fold cross-validation, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Case studies on obesity, schizophrenia, and Crohn's disease validate 96.7\% of predicted associations through literature evidence. DHG-LGB provides a powerful tool for computational metabolomics and precision medicine.},
